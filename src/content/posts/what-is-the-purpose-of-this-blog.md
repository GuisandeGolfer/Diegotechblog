The intent of this blog is to start cultivating the practice of sharing the information that I learn. Ideally, I would like to become better and better in transforming information into a medium that is fun, informative, and actionable for readers.

I should let you know a little bit about myself first.

### Who Am I?

> I am a creative problem solver who is trying to find my passions while enjoying the process of creativity and utilizing technology.

I am guilty of over-planning and [analysis paralysis](./post-2).

In light of that, I wanted to publish this site so I can get the ball rolling, and start sharing information with others.

_If you don't already know me_,

**Hi I am Diego**. I am born and raised in California, I have a Bachelor's in Business, and I love learning about new and interesting things.

> I believe that, given time, anyone can learn whatever skill they want and there are no boundaries to education. The internet has the wealth of human information at the tips of our fingers, but it is normal to
> not take advantage of this.

#### Why am I talking about this?

This blog post is the cultivation of this mindset and ...

- from watching productivity "_gurus_" on Youtube.
- Reading
- speaking with those I look up to in life.
- Discovering through personal experience.

And now I want to share a couple of things that has inspired me to create this blog.

#### What I am going to cover?

1. What I will be writing about.
2. Why I want to start writing in the first place.
3. Who inspired me to start.
4. How I got to this point.
5. Why you should build a "_Second Brain_".

#### Exploring My Interests

I don't think I could list the amount of things that peak my curiosity or interest within a month.

A general list from my [second brain]() looks a bit like this:

- Creating an digital marketing agency.
- Getting my Real Estate Salesperson license.
- Starting a Wordpress blog.
- Learning to trade options.
- Trying to finish my Amazon book list.
- Brazilian and Japanese music from the 70's.
- Generative AI.

The list goes on ...

I hope to use the growth of my knowledge in these areas to create articles, resources, and guides that can be a launching point for someone to learn more.

#### Becoming a Better Writer

I started recording my thoughts and ideas in journals since 2018, but I would never review what I wrote and it still didn't solve procrastination; professionally or personally.

After reading [_Building a Second Brain_](https://amzn.to/3L2Vs9h) by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/), I realized that having a methodology to my notes completely changes your relationship to the things that come into your life.

The switch to digital notes helped me see that _Ctrl + F_ had more power than scrubbing through blog posts or textbooks. In all seriousness, taking digital notes has become a pillar in my life and finding a system that works for you is worth the effort.

I have now reached the point in my digital note-taking journey where I needed to finally express what I have been curating.

In the book, Tiago discusses how we shouldn't wait to share what we know because **it will never be perfect**. Start small, gather feedback, and compound your knowledge over time.

An excerpt that expresses (**Ba dum tss**) this idea is:

> The final stage of the creative process, Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know. It is about expressing your ideas earlier, more frequently, and in smaller chunks to test what works and gather feedback from others. That feedback in turn gets drawn in to your Second Brain, where it becomes the starting point for the next iteration of your work.

If you want a brief review of _Building a Second Brain_, [Melanie Knight](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/knight-melanie_buildingasecondbrain-personalknowledgemanagement-activity-7035324773115031552-BfpR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) created a great graphic:

#### Origin Story

Before using digital notes, I was learning how to build websites and how to code. This process brought me to learning [how to use vim](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vim-beginners-guide/).

If you want a quick explaination of vim: "**you can edit text documents and move around the page without having to use your mouse**".

This allowed me to be able to type and move around the page as soon as I knew what I wanted to write.

I then started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) after a friend suggested it. This app changed the way that I think about how notes are interconnected.

I used [ Notion ](https://notion.so) before Obsidian but Notion was easy for me to over-complicate and I would get stuck in logical circles and get nothing done.

Now everything I do is now in Obsidian:

1. My calendar (connected to Google Calendar)
2. Task manager (with the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin)
3. Journal
4. etc.

I even added the functionality to write blog posts like this inside of obsidian and with a single command I can upload it to this blog site!

### Learning and Growth

I can't express my appreciation for the growth and peace of mind that having a single source of personal truth has gave me. I hope that my writing style and depth will evolve over time, and I can create different forms of information on
social media, youtube, etc.

If the person reading this is overwhelmed with the information, I have some good news; _you don't need to do it all at once._

Starting can be as small as writing down an appointment in Apple Notes (or whatever Android uses). If you want someone to do it for you, I am sorry to say that's not going to be possible.

Pick a tool, stick to it for 60 days and after 60 days, if there is still a lot of functionality missing, then you can look for a "better" tool.

If you want a video series describing this process, I recommend Tiago Forte's beginner series on Youtube. **Start here**

### Expressing Gratitude

**Thank you so much for making this far in the post**. I may have veered a way from the core of "What is the Goal of this Blog?", nonetheless I am happy you are still here.

I hope that this has given you something to work with or use to enrich your life. If you want to learn more, _don't hesitate to contact me and we can start cooking something up_.

Setting up a newsletter is one of my top priorities so readers can get updates to new posts or any fun resources or things I have learned in between.

Thank you again for staying with me this far, and hopefully we'll see each other soon.
